# Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project 1

For this project I have written Javascript code that generates a random quote for a webpage. The button on the webpage is programmed so that when it is clicked another quote is shown.
I am going for an 'exceeds expectations' grade and therefore I have added a 'category' to some of the quotes, random background colors, and auto-refreshed quotes.
